# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow uses step-security/harden-runner GitHub Action
# to restrict outbound traffic to allowed endpoints. Observing
# network connectivity during the test stage of the CI pipeline
# can help detect potentially compromised upstream dependencies.
# For more information on the Harden Runner Action usage and
# parameters, see https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner.
